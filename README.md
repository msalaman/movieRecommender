To run the project, simply clone repository and run `./main.py`. You can opt to provide the twitter username up-front `./main.py abbylan78016969` or you will be prompted when you run it. To run over the selection of top 40 accounts (by default) or any users listed in the `test_users` file, use the `test.sh` script. Most other files in the repository aren't necessary to run main.py, but genreKeywords.py and ml-latest-small folder are required.
