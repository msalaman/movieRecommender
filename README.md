To run the project, simply clone repository and run `./main.py`. NOTE: You must type in your own Twitter API credentials in main.py on your local repository for this program to work (Please do not push your credentials to this repository). You can opt to provide the twitter username up-front `./main.py abbylan78016969` or you will be prompted when you run it. To run over the selection of top 40 accounts (by default) or any users listed in the `test_users` file, use the `test.sh` script. Most other files in the repository aren't necessary to run main.py, but genreKeywords.py and ml-latest-small folder are required.
